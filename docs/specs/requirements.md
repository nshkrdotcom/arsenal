# Arsenal Operations Requirements Specification

## Overview

This document defines the requirements for implementing Arsenal operations across the APEX ecosystem, including Arsenal, Sandbox, ClusterTest, SuperLearner, and related components. The operations are derived from the comprehensive OTP API catalog and focus on essential functionality for process supervision, system introspection, and distributed management.

## Non-Functional Requirements

### Performance
- Operations must complete within 100ms for local operations
- Distributed operations should complete within 500ms
- Batch operations should support up to 1000 items

### Reliability
- All operations must be idempotent where possible
- Failed operations must not leave system in inconsistent state
- Graceful degradation for unavailable nodes

### Security
- Authentication required for all write operations
- Authorization based on operation severity
- Audit logging for all state-changing operations

### Compatibility
- Support Elixir 1.12+
- OTP 24+
- Compatible with Phoenix framework
- REST API following JSON:API specification

### Observability
- All operations emit telemetry events
- Structured logging with correlation IDs
- Metrics exported in Prometheus format

## Integration Requirements

### Arsenal Core
- All operations implement `Arsenal.Operation` behaviour
- Registration with `Arsenal.Registry`
- Analytics integration via `Arsenal.AnalyticsServer`

### Sandbox Integration
- Operations respect sandbox isolation
- Resource tracking per sandbox
- State preservation across restarts

### ClusterTest Support
- Operations testable in simulated clusters
- Deterministic behavior for testing
- Mock-friendly interfaces

### SuperLearner Analytics
- Operation metrics collection
- Performance baselines
- Anomaly detection integration

## Validation Criteria

### Functional Testing
- Unit tests for each operation
- Integration tests for operation combinations
- Property-based testing for invariants

### Performance Testing
- Load testing with concurrent operations
- Stress testing resource limits
- Benchmark comparisons with direct OTP calls

### Security Testing
- Permission boundary validation
- Input sanitization verification
- Audit trail completeness

## Success Metrics

- 95% operation success rate under normal load
- <1% performance overhead vs direct OTP calls
- Zero security vulnerabilities in operation layer
- 100% operation discoverability via registry
