# Arsenal Implementation Summary

## Completed Tasks

### 1. Fixed Intermittent Test Failure
- **Issue**: Arsenal.AnalyticsServerTest had race condition between process termination and cleanup
- **Solution**: Refactored to use direct GenServer.start_link instead of start_supervised to avoid name conflicts
- **File**: `test/arsenal/analytics_server_test.exs`

### 2. Fixed Division by Zero Bug
- **Issue**: `check_memory_health/1` could divide by zero if memory.total was 0
- **Solution**: Added guard to check if memory.total > 0 before division
- **File**: `lib/arsenal/analytics_server.ex:628`

### 3. Implemented New Phase 2 Operations

#### get_process_info Operation
- **File**: `lib/arsenal/operations/get_process_info.ex`
- **Features**:
  - Retrieves comprehensive process information
  - Supports filtering by specific keys
  - Includes memory usage (which isn't in default Process.info/1)
  - Full Arsenal.Operation behaviour implementation
  
#### restart_process Operation  
- **File**: `lib/arsenal/operations/restart_process.ex`
- **Features**:
  - Restarts supervised processes by terminating and letting supervisor restart
  - Finds supervisor through $ancestors or links
  - Waits for restart with configurable timeout
  - Marked as dangerous operation requiring authentication

### 4. Enhanced Operation Discovery and Registration
- **File**: `lib/arsenal/startup.ex`
- **Features**:
  - Automatic discovery of all Arsenal.Operations modules
  - Bulk registration on application startup
  - Comprehensive logging of registration results

### 5. Integration and Testing
- Created comprehensive tests for new operations
- Added registry integration tests
- Fixed API documentation generation to handle different parameter formats
- All 184 tests passing

## Architecture Improvements

1. **Operation Discovery**: Operations are now automatically discovered and registered on startup
2. **Registry Integration**: New operations integrate seamlessly with Arsenal.Registry
3. **Error Handling**: Proper error handling for edge cases (dead processes, non-supervised processes)
4. **Type Safety**: Full implementation of Arsenal.Operation behaviour with proper callbacks

## Next Steps (from original tasks.md)

Phase 3 would include:
- Supervisor operations (restart_child, delete_child, etc.)
- System operations (memory info, scheduler info)
- Distributed operations (connect nodes, remote execution)

The foundation is now solid for implementing additional operations following the same patterns.
